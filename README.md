### **Slide 5: Economic Proxies**

**Increased Insurance Claims → Floods:**

- **Australia:** The 2022 floods resulted in more than 240,000 insurance claims with a total value of $6 billion, marking it as the second-largest insured event in the world for that year. 

- **Africa:** In the first half of 2024, natural disasters in Africa led to economic losses of US$0.5 billion, with a significant portion attributed to floods.

### **Slide 6: Behavioral Proxies**

**Increased Internet Usage → Floods:**

- **Australia:** During the March 2022 floods, the Northern Rivers region experienced significant internet outages, indicating a disruption in communication patterns due to extreme weather events. 

- **India:** In August 2024, heavy monsoon rains led to severe flooding in southern India, resulting in power outages and flight cancellations, which likely increased reliance on internet communication for information and coordination.

### **Slide 8: Remote Sensing Proxies**

**Satellite Imagery Analysis → Floods:**

- **Australia:** Remote sensing technologies have been employed to assess soil moisture levels and vegetation health, crucial for drought monitoring.

- **Africa:** The EU-funded Fanfar platform provides flood forecasting for West Africa, helping in early warning and disaster preparedness. 

**Visual Suggestion:**

### **Slide 9: Community and Cultural Proxies**

**Social Media Activity → Floods:**

- **Australia:** During the 2022 floods, communities utilized social media platforms to coordinate relief efforts and disseminate information, reflecting increased online activity in response to flooding.

- **India:** In August 2024, heavy monsoon rains led to severe flooding in southern India, resulting in the closure of schools, colleges, and government offices in major cities such as Chennai and Bengaluru. 

**Visual Suggestion:**
